**02:01 10/27/2025**

Resume from anchor: [Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Test_Suite_Debug_Sisyphus_Was_a_Weenie]
Context: The Azure VM now executes the full Spark pipeline with the correct environment. SPARK_HOME is fixed (/opt/spark), and Spark 3.5.3 launches cleanly. Logging is anchored to absolute paths, and the system-level environment parity playbook has been drafted to prevent future drift. The pipeline currently halts on a missing Python dependency (rapidfuzz) within the VM environment.

Current milestone:
‚úÖ Environment synchronization achieved across local and VM contexts
‚úÖ Spark initialization verified via /opt/spark
‚úÖ Absolute-path logging confirmed functional
‚úÖ Root cause of historical ‚Äúno such file‚Äù and PATH drift fully resolved

Next action:
Rebuild and synchronize the VM‚Äôs virtual environment to include all Python modules from requirements_stable.txt (e.g., rapidfuzz, pyspark, python-dotenv), then rerun run_pipeline_safe.sh to confirm complete end-to-end pipeline execution without module errors.

Dependencies:

SSH key: ~/.ssh/ungcapvm01-key.pem

Azure VM: ungcapvm01 (172.190.228.102) active

Files: requirements_stable.txt, .env, run_pipeline_safe.sh (refactored)

Tools: pip, tar, spark-submit, pytest

Environment: pyspark_venv311 virtualenv in /home/azureuser/unguided-capstone-project/



**Resume from anchor:** [Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Test_Suite_Debug_Finale]

**Context:** The Azure VM (`ungcapvm01`) is fully configured, connected via SSH, and executing the Spark-based pipeline from the `step8-dev` branch. Live log streaming is functional both locally and remotely. The `.env` and `movie_titles_200.txt` files are properly deployed. Step 02 (Discogs pull) is currently in progress.

**Current milestone:**
 ‚úÖ Azure test environment deployed and verified
 ‚úÖ Spark pipeline executing remotely under test conditions
 ‚úÖ Real-time log streaming confirmed
 ‚úÖ Unit test and coverage framework integrated with remote deploy script

**Next action:**
 Wait for the pipeline to complete all steps and `pytest` to finish execution, then retrieve and review `~/test_results/pipeline_run.log` and `pytest_report.log` for pass/fail metrics and coverage percentage.

**Dependencies:**

- Azure VM (`ungcapvm01`, IP: `172.190.228.102`) active and accessible
- SSH private key: `~/.ssh/ungcapvm01-key.pem`
- Environment file: `.env` synced and valid
- Dataset: `data/movie_titles_200.txt` committed in repo
- Python virtual environment: `pyspark_venv311`
- Tools: `pytest`, `spark-submit`, `scp`, `tar`



**23:00 10/26/2025**

**Resume from anchor:** [Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Test_Suite_Debug_II]

**Context:**
 The unified pipeline test suite for the Unguided Capstone is now running fully end-to-end.
 Base class (`BaseStep`) initialization has been stabilized ‚Äî `metrics_dir` and `output_dir` are now properly resolved and logged.
 The pipeline successfully passes environment validation and begins executing Spark-based steps.
 We‚Äôre now moving from structural errors (missing attributes, imports) to step-level debugging and output validation.

**Current milestone:**
 ‚úÖ `BaseStep` constructor fixed and verified.
 ‚úÖ Step 01 (`Step01AcquireTMDB`) now initializes successfully.
 ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline test (`test_pipeline_success.py`) executes and fails at a later stage ‚Äî expected during incremental validation.

**Next action:**
 Run the single-test diagnostic again to capture the current failure context:

```
pytest -s scripts/tests/test_pipeline_success.py
```

Then share the **last 25‚Äì30 lines of STDOUT and STDERR** (starting from the first red ‚ÄúTraceback‚Äù) here.
 This will isolate the next breaking step (likely Step 02 or Step 03) and guide the minimal fix needed for forward progress.

**Dependencies:**

- Environment variables: `PIPELINE_OUTPUT_DIR`, `PIPELINE_METRICS_DIR`, `TMDB_API_KEY`
- Tools: `pytest`, `pyspark_venv311`, configured `config.py` and updated `BaseStep`
- Person: Mark (for test execution + log capture)





**20:47 10/26/2025**

**Resume from anchor:** [Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Test_Suite_Debug]
 **Context:** You‚Äôve stabilized all Step 8 test scaffolding ‚Äî pytest executes cleanly for environment and match/enrich scripts. However, the full pipeline test still fails artifact detection, suggesting an environment propagation or path override mismatch. The debug phase now targets the `PIPELINE_OUTPUT_DIR` flow and file write behavior.
 **Current milestone:** All tests run end-to-end; two of three pass. `test_pipeline_completes_and_outputs` still fails due to missing (or misplaced) output artifacts.
 **Next action:** Run a **single verbose test** to capture the live logs and environment state:

```
pytest -s scripts/tests/test_pipeline_success.py
```

Then paste the last ~30 lines of console output (STDOUT + STDERR) here for analysis.
 **Dependencies:**

- Active `pyspark_venv311` virtual environment
- Updated `scripts/main.py` with the debug snapshot block
- Local repo branch `step8-dev`
- Access to `/tmp/pytest-of-mark/` directories for artifact verification



**14:40 10/26/2025**

## üß≠ **Anchor Update**

**Resume from anchor:** `[Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Test_Suite_Init]`
 **Context:** Your Azure pipeline now executes end-to-end successfully. It produces reliable local logs, verified environment parity, and Spark tasks complete cleanly.
 **Current milestone:** Stable Step 8 deployment with reproducible environment and log retrieval.
 **Next action:** Build a unit + integration test suite to validate correctness, edge-case behavior, and pipeline stability.
 **Dependencies:** Local repo (`step8-dev` branch), pytest integration, existing logs for baseline comparison.

------

## üß© **Test Suite Objectives (per rubric)**

From Step 8 PDF :

- ‚úÖ All code used in the pipeline must have **unit tests**.
- ‚úÖ Produce a **report** with:
  - Number of passed/failed tests
  - Code coverage %
- ‚úÖ Add test overview + results snapshot to your **slide deck**.

------

## üß± **Recommended Folder Layout**

```
unguided-capstone-project/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/tests/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_env_validation.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_pipeline_success.py
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_step05_match_and_enrich.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ conftest.py
```

------

## üß™ **Tiered Testing Plan**

| Tier                  | Scope                                      | Example                                                      | Tool                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Unit tests**        | Validate small functions in each module    | Verify helper functions in `scripts_spark/05_spark_match_and_enrich.py` (e.g. string matching logic) | `pytest`              |
| **Integration tests** | Validate that the pipeline runs end-to-end | Confirm pipeline completes without exception and produces metrics file | `pytest + subprocess` |
| **System smoke test** | Validate environment on Azure VM           | Reuse your `verify_env.py` for a single test case            | `pytest`              |

------

## üß© **Next Micro-Goal**

Start with **3 foundation tests**:

| File                              | Test Focus                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `test_env_validation.py`          | Calls `verify_env.py` to ensure all dependencies + env vars present |
| `test_pipeline_success.py`        | Runs your main pipeline entry (`main.py`) and asserts it exits 0 + output file exists |
| `test_step05_match_and_enrich.py` | Imports key function(s) from Step 05 and checks sample behavior |

Once those work locally, we‚Äôll add **pytest-cov** and generate your coverage report for the deliverable.

------

Would you like me to generate clean starter code for those three test files (each ‚â§ 40 lines, fully runnable under pytest) so you can drop them straight into `scripts/tests/` and begin iterating tomorrow?









**01:58 10/26/2025**

**Resume from anchor:** [Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Azure_Eternal_Damnation]

**Context:** Working Azure VM-based deployment pipeline for the unguided capstone project is still unstable. The simplified `deploy_to_azure_test.sh` failed immediately after SSH invocation, likely due to missing or mis-evaluated environment variables or shell expansion behavior. Spark and pytest both verified on VM manually; pipeline automation remains the blocker.

**Current milestone:**
 Repo successfully clones on VM, Spark runs manually, blob uploads verified. Deploy script nearly functional but not executing commands as intended via SSH heredoc.

**Next action:**
 Debug SSH command invocation ‚Äî confirm that inline remote commands execute and paths expand properly on the VM (i.e., ensure `bash -i` heredoc context is correct). Simplify to a minimal echo test before adding Spark and pytest steps back.

**Dependencies:**

- Azure CLI logged in with Service Principal credentials (`SP_APP_ID`, `SP_PASSWORD`, `SP_TENANT_ID`)
- Working VM access (public IP + SSH key)
- GitHub repo: `unguided-capstone-project`
- Spark preinstalled and callable via `spark-submit` on VM
- Local Ubuntu dev environment (Mark-ASUS

------

### **Context:**

We‚Äôre mid-sprint on the *Step 8 ‚Äî Azure Deployment Integration* phase of the Unguided Capstone Project.
 After migrating the repo clone from `step6-submission` to `step8-dev`, we rebuilt Azure authentication with a **Service Principal + Managed Identity** model.
 The latest `deploy_to_azure_test.sh` successfully authenticated, launched the VM, ran tests, and reached the **Managed Identity upload step**, but a serious runtime error appeared during the upload (hung for ~8 minutes before failing).

------

### **Current milestone:**

- ‚úÖ Service Principal (`vm-deploy-automation`) created and granted *User Access Administrator*.
- ‚úÖ VM (`ungcapvm01`) identity configured with *Storage Blob Data Contributor* access.
- ‚úÖ SSH + GitHub integration functional (via deploy key).
- ‚úÖ Repo correctly cloned (`step8-dev`) to VM during deploy.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Upload phase fails intermittently ‚Äî long runtime, no completion, possible token or storage data-plane delay.

------

### **Next action:**

üîß Diagnose and patch the **Managed Identity upload timeout** in `deploy_to_azure_test.sh` ‚Äî verify AAD token validity, confirm container access at data-plane, and test CLI upload manually (`az storage blob upload-batch --auth-mode login --overwrite`).
 Once validated, re-run the full deployment pipeline to confirm end-to-end success.

------

### **Dependencies:**

- Keys: `.env` with Service Principal credentials
- Environment: `ungcapvm01`, `ungcapstor01`, `rg-unguidedcapstone-test`
- Tools: Azure CLI (`2.78.0+`), Python 3.11 venv, bash deploy script

Context:
 We‚Äôre stabilizing Step 6 (‚ÄúScale Your Prototype‚Äù) of the Unguided Capstone after migrating TMDB and Discogs extraction scripts to PySpark for Databricks + ADLS Gen2. Both jobs now run through the cluster, but output validation shows malformed title parsing and incorrect ADLS URIs traced to legacy config logic. Environment, secrets, and managed-identity access are verified.

Current milestone:
 ‚úÖ Spark runtime confirmed (Databricks 14.3 LTS, Connect off)
 ‚úÖ Managed Identity + ADLS Gen2 external location verified
 ‚úÖ Both PySpark scripts execute end-to-end
 üöß Data write and title handling bugs identified in `extract_spark_tmdb.py` and `extract_spark_discogs.py`

Next action:
 üîß Patch both extract scripts to (a) coerce `GOLDEN_TITLES_TEST` into a list of titles instead of characters, and (b) lock `container_uri` and `tmdb_path` to the correct ADLS Gen2 URIs (`markcapstoneadls`). Retest Databricks execution and validate Parquet outputs in `/raw/tmdb/` and `/raw/discogs/`.

**12:04 10/20/2025**

**Resume from anchor:**
 `[ANCHOR_NAUnguidedCapstone_TMDB_Refactor02_Step_06_Submission_Debug]`

**Context:**
 Working on Step 6 (‚ÄúScale Your Prototype‚Äù) of the Unguided Capstone.
 TMDB extraction runs successfully in Databricks but output verification fails ‚Äî writes to local DBFS instead of Azure Blob.
 We‚Äôve built a new cluster (`capstone-blob-cluster`, Spark 3.5.0, Scala 2.12) and validated Azure secret scope `markscope`.
 Current focus: achieving a working WASBS-based write to the Blob container (`raw@markcapstonestorage.blob.core.windows.net`).

**Current milestone:**
 ‚úÖ  Verified Spark environment on Databricks runtime 14.3 LTS
 ‚úÖ  Confirmed secret retrieval from `markscope`
 ‚úÖ  Validated ABFS + mount configs fail under current cluster policy
 üöß  Debugging direct WASBS connector write (SharedKey authentication)

**Next action:**
 Test direct WASBS write using this working minimal cell:

```
spark.conf.set(
    "fs.azure.account.key.markcapstonestorage.blob.core.windows.net",
