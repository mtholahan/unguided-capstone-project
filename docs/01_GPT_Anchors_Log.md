**Resume from anchor:** `Capstone_Step8_Why_Am_I_Doing_This`

**Context:** We‚Äôre deep in Spark‚ÄìAzure integration on the unguided capstone project. The pipeline runs, virtual env is stable, and Spark 3.5.6 executes. However, Spark fails to authenticate/write to ADLS via OAuth because the Hadoop runtime isn‚Äôt being detected (Spark built without embedded Hadoop). We‚Äôve confirmed all correct JARs and configs are in place.

**Current milestone:**

- Spark builder refactored and simplified (`build_spark_session()` now clean and validated).
- Environment variables verified and `.env` loader working.
- OAuth credentials confirmed valid.
- ADLS write still failing due to missing Hadoop runtime recognition.

**Next action:**
 ‚Üí Add and export the Hadoop classpath so Spark detects ABFS OAuth support:

```
export SPARK_DIST_CLASSPATH="/home/mark/spark/jars/*"
```

Then re-run the test script (`main.py`) to confirm Spark prints ‚ÄúUsing Hadoop 3.3.4‚Äù and successfully writes to `abfss://raw@ungcaptor01.dfs.core.windows.net/test_write_check`.

**Dependencies:**

- Env vars (`AZURE_APP_ID`, `AZURE_APP_SECRET`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`, `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY`)
- Python venv: `/home/mark/pyspark_venv311`
- JARs in `/home/mark/spark/jars` (hadoop-azure, azure-storage, azure-data-lake-sdk)
- `$SPARK_HOME` correctly pointing to `/home/mark/spark`



11:48 10/31/2025

**Resume from anchor:** [Spark_Life_Sucking_Horror]

**Context:**
 Spark on WSL Ubuntu authenticates successfully with Azure ADLS and writes test data to the `raw/` container.
 However, executor JVMs continue to fail with `Cannot run program "./pyspark_venv311/bin/python"`, indicating Spark is spawning workers with a relative Python path despite absolute paths configured.
 We are one step away from resolving this via environment isolation and Spark configuration validation.

**Current milestone:**

- ‚úÖ Azure storage connectivity verified (`test_write_check` written successfully)
- ‚úÖ Spark driver authenticates with ADLS and runs
- ‚ùå Executors misconfigured with relative Python path
- ‚ùå `$SPARK_HOME` and Spark binary alignment pending verification

**Next action:**
 Run the diagnostic and isolation sequence (Steps 1‚Äì3):

1. Verify Spark binary alignment:

   ```
   echo $SPARK_HOME
   which spark-submit
   ls -l $SPARK_HOME/conf
   ```

2. Create `/home/mark/my_spark_conf/spark-env.sh` with absolute interpreter paths.

3. Execute the diagnostic test block (the ‚Äúconf_probe‚Äù command) to confirm Spark picks up the correct Python executable for executors.

**Dependencies:**

- üß† You (mark) for local execution in WSL
- üß∞ Tools: Spark 3.5.6, Ubuntu WSL2, Python venv at `/home/mark/pyspark_venv311`
- üîë Environment variables: `$SPARK_HOME`, `$SPARK_CONF_DIR`
- ü™£ Azure ADLS container: `ungcaptor01/raw` (for write verification)



**03:05 10/31/2025**

Resume from anchor: Spark_ADLS_Auth_Fix
Context: Spark 3.5.6 environment now stable; gateway and Hadoop classpath fully resolved. 
TMDB extract script executes end-to-end via spark-submit but fails on ADLS write due to missing authentication. 
Next step is to enable secure ADLS access using environment-based credentials (Option B). 

Current milestone: ‚úÖ Spark runtime verified (PySpark + Java + Hadoop-Azure jars); write path confirmed valid. 

Next action: Inject `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` and `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY` into environment and modify `SparkSession.builder` config to use these for ADLS access. 

Dependencies: Active venv (`pyspark_venv311`), valid ADLS account/key pair, Spark 3.5.6 binary in `~/spark`, write_path target in `config_env`.







**19:50 10/30/2025**

**Resume from anchor:** Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Knee_Deep

**Context:**
 The unified environment-aware refactor is complete and all pipeline steps (TMDB ‚Üí Discogs ‚Üí Schema Validation) now execute without runtime errors. However, no data artifacts are being generated ‚Äî suggesting paths are resolving correctly but writing to the wrong locations or overwriting one another. Folder creation logic is inconsistent, leading to redundant directories (e.g., nested `/data/data/...` or `/data/intermediate/intermediate`).

**Current milestone:**
 ‚úÖ End-to-end pipeline runs cleanly
 ‚úÖ All environment loaders, utils, and caching logic stabilized
 ‚ö†Ô∏è Output and cache directories misaligned ‚Äî no final artifacts visible in expected folders

**Next action:**
 üîç Audit and normalize all output directory references across steps (ensure each writes to a single canonical data root). Specifically:

- Print/log `self.output_dir` and `self.raw_dir` in each step class before write operations.
- Verify that paths resolve under the expected `<project_root>/data/...` structure.
- Adjust environment setup in `base_step.py` or each Spark script to unify `root_path` resolution (no nested `data` prefixes).

**Dependencies:**

- `.env` file (ROOT or root key)
- Updated utils: `get_env_path()`, `ensure_dirs()`
- Python environment: `pyspark_venv311`
- Local and Azure sync automation scripts (for cross-checking actual data directories)

------

Would you like me to generate a **1-command diagnostic script** that logs all resolved directories (root/output/raw/cache/metrics) across every step to pinpoint where your data is being written?





**17:55 10/30/2025**

**Resume from anchor:** [Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Neck_Deep]

**Context:** Deep in the pipeline simplification and environment refactor phase. Core utils package (env, io_utils, logging, base_step, etc.) now unified and passing tests. Spark step scripts partially refactored to use the new environment-aware utilities. Discogs API currently failing due to environment variable load issues.

**Current milestone:**
 ‚úÖ Utils package modularized and verified via pytest
 ‚úÖ TMDB pipeline step (Step 1) running successfully under new structure
 ‚ö†Ô∏è Discogs (Step 2) 401 error traced to `.env` not loading in runtime environment

**Next action:**
 üîß Fix and verify `.env` loader (in `scripts/utils/env.py`) so Discogs credentials populate correctly, then re-run pipeline to confirm Step 2 success.

**Dependencies:**

- `.env` file at project root (`DISCOGS_CONSUMER_KEY`, `DISCOGS_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `DISCOGS_USER_AGENT`)
- Python `python-dotenv` module
- Active virtual environment (`pyspark_venv311`)
- File: `scripts/utils/env.py` (to patch loader)







**14:08 10/30/2025**

‚úÖ Anchor **[Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Downhill]** loaded successfully.

**Context:** The refactored `orchestrate_pipeline.py` successfully replaced `main.py` as the unified execution layer. All five Spark-driven pipeline steps now execute sequentially under clean `.env` control, confirming environment stability, Spark/Java integrity, and proper subprocess orchestration. We‚Äôve exited the debugging loop and reached a deployable, reliable local state.

**Current milestone:**
 Pipeline ran end-to-end locally via `orchestrate_pipeline.py` with no Java gateway, PATH, or Spark bootstrap errors. Environment, .env logic, and Spark session handling are now validated.

**Next action:**
 Add minimal checkpointing (JSON write after each successful step) and prepare the orchestrator + environment for Azure VM replication and testing.

**Dependencies:**

- `pyspark_venv311` (active, clean)
- `.env` with PIPELINE_ROOT and LOG_LEVEL
- Working `orchestrate_pipeline.py` in repo root
- Azure VM access + SSH key for next-stage sync

We‚Äôre officially **downhill** from here. üöÄ



**00:26 10/30/2025**

Resume from anchor: [Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Limbo]
Context: PATH variable corruption occurred during environment activation, breaking access to core system binaries (grep, nl, etc.). Spark and venv still functional; TMDB extraction confirmed successful prior to the environment disruption. Focus is stabilizing shell/venv integrity before full pipeline run and Azure deployment.
Current milestone: TMDB ingestion fixed and verified; logging streamlined; directory structure corrected; environment and .env logic validated.
Next action: Verify PATH integrity after venv activation, confirm /usr/bin is restored, and re-test safe environment variable loading using:
   set -a && source .env && set +a
Dependencies: 

- pyspark_venv311 (reactivated cleanly)
- .env file with PIPELINE_ROOT and LOG_LEVEL
- Ubuntu terminal session with /usr/bin in PATH
- Git branches: step8-dev and step8-submission

Let's resume from this anchor ‚Äî beginning with a 15-second PATH sanity check before the full pipeline run.



**22:15 10/29/2025**

‚úÖ **Resume from anchor:** [Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Redemption]

**Context:**
 The pipeline is functional but misdirects output to a literal `$(pwd)` directory instead of expanding it dynamically. This broke TMDB ingestion, producing empty `{}` JSONs and fake ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù logs. Spark/PySpark setup is stable again, and TMDB API key retrieval is confirmed working at both Python and JVM levels.

**Current milestone:**
 Root cause confirmed ‚Äî path construction uses hardcoded `$(pwd)` placeholders instead of `Path.cwd()` or `os.getcwd()`. Spark session now properly initializes with TMDB key loaded.

**Next action:**
 Replace all `$(pwd)` path templates in pipeline scripts (e.g., `config.py`, `spark_extract_tmdb.py`, or any step writing to `data/intermediate`) with proper `Path` objects. Then rerun a short subset of the pipeline (TMDB extract only) to confirm correct file creation under `/data/intermediate/tmdb_raw`.

**Dependencies:**

- `TMDB_API_KEY` in `.env`
- `pyspark_venv311` active
- Files: `config.py`, `config_env.py`, and `spark_extract_tmdb.py`
- Tooling: VS Code + Ubuntu terminal
- Optional: version control checkpoint (`git branch step8-debug-pathfix`)

Would you like me to generate a quick **path-fix diff** (safe replacements for `$(pwd)` usage) before you start?



**15:43 10/29/2025**

‚úÖ Anchor **[Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_No_Data]** loaded successfully.

------

**Resume from anchor:** [Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_No_Data]
 **Context:** The full pipeline executed locally without Spark or module errors, confirming environment stability. However, no API calls appear to have executed, and no data artifacts were produced ‚Äî likely indicating missing environment variables, disabled API logic, or misrouted file paths in `config_env.py`.
 **Current milestone:** Spark runtime, pipeline orchestration, and step execution sequencing all validated under WSL. VM deployment ready but not yet re-tested post-fix.
 **Next action:** Verify API integration and data artifact generation by checking `scripts/config_env.py` for valid API keys, endpoint URLs, and I/O paths, then rerun the pipeline with logging enabled (`python3 scripts/main.py --debug`) to confirm calls and outputs.
 **Dependencies:**

- `.env` file (with TMDB or enrichment API keys)
- `scripts/config_env.py` (for endpoint configuration and environment loading)
- Network access for API calls
- Local write permissions for `/data/output/`

------

Please guide me through a **config_env integrity check** next ‚Äî step by step confirming API key loading, endpoint reachability, and artifact output paths.



**13:31 10/29/2025**

**Resume from anchor:** [Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Test_Suite]

**Context:** The Step 8 pipeline (deployment validation) is currently failing to launch Spark due to an environment path/configuration issue. Core pipeline scripts are stable and verified from earlier steps, but PySpark cannot locate the correct `spark-submit` binary. Deadline for full capstone completion is **Friday, Oct 31**.

**Current milestone:**

- Steps 1‚Äì7 completed and validated.
- Step 8 code finalized, but Spark session launch fails (`[JAVA_GATEWAY_EXITED]`).
- Environment verified: Python venv active, Java 17 installed, Spark 3.5.3 unpacked locally.

**Next action:**

- Restore pipeline execution by fixing Spark binary visibility and confirming `spark-submit --version` works under the current shell.
   ‚Üí Run:

  ```
  unset SPARK_HOME
  unset PATH
  export SPARK_HOME=/home/mark/spark-3.5.3-bin-hadoop3
  export PATH=$SPARK_HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
  spark-submit --version
  ```

  Once this prints the Spark version, re-run:

  ```
  python scripts/main.py --resume step_05_match_and_enrich
  ```

**Dependencies:**

- Tools: PySpark, Java 17 (OpenJDK), local Spark 3.5.3 install
- Environment: Correct `$SPARK_HOME` and `$PATH` variables
- No new code or files ‚Äî current repo and configuration only



**11:14 10/29/2025**

**Resume from anchor:** [Unguided_Capstone_Step_08_Test_Suite_A_New_Long_Day]

**Context:** The Step 8 development branch is stable. The VM deployment flow, validation routines, and post-sync logging are all integrated. The pipeline runs successfully on both local and VM environments, and the new `vm_quickops.sh` automation provides seamless post-deploy validation. Functional tests are partially passing, with some metrics path and fixture refinements pending.

**Current milestone:** ‚úÖ Deployment and environment validation pipeline completed; üß≠ VM QuickOps script integrated with deploy automation; üß™ core test suite operational but with Step 05 enrichment test failures under investigation.

**Next action:** Refactor and stabilize the test suite to achieve full pass status (starting with `test_match_and_enrich_runs_successfully`) and confirm consistent metrics generation paths between local and VM runs.

**Dependencies:**

- Access to Azure VM `ungcapvm01` (`~/.ssh/ungcapvm01-key.pem`)
- Active Python venv `pyspark_venv311` with pytest installed
- GitHub branch: `step8-dev`
- `.env` properly sourced during deploy/validation
- Files: `scripts/tests/test_match_and_enrich.py`, `main.py`, `deploy_to_vm.sh`, `vm_quickops.sh`
