# ðŸ“˜ Documentation Index â€“ Unguided Capstone Project

_Last updated: October 6, 2025_

Welcome to the documentation hub for the **Unguided Capstone Project (MusicBrainz Ã— TMDb)**.  
This folder provides the mentor-facing reference materials that describe project workflow, branching discipline, and milestone progress.

## ðŸ§­ Mentor Workflow

**File:** [`mentor_workflow.md`](./mentor_workflow.md)

Defines the standardized **Git branchâ€“based submission process** used for all mentor reviews (Steps 5â€“10).  
Explains:
- How to create and name submission branches  
- How feedback branches and tags are handled  
- When and how development continues in parallel  

ðŸ‘‰ _Akhil should reference this document for clarity on branch names during review._

## ðŸ§¾ Changelog and Review Log

**File:** [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md)

Chronologically tracks all **step submissions, mentor feedback, and approvals**.  
Each entry lists:
- Submission branch name  
- Approval tag (once reviewed)  
- Technical summary of what was delivered  
- Key notes and dependencies  

ðŸ‘‰ _This doubles as the formal milestone audit trail for Springboard documentation._
