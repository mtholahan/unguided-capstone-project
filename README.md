🎮 Musical Diversity in Movies – Springboard Capstone

📌 Project Overview

This capstone project explores the relationship between a film’s soundtrack genre diversity and its movie-level metadata, such as popularity, release year, and genre classification.

By integrating soundtrack data from MusicBrainz with enriched movie data from TMDb, the project builds a normalized dataset that enables querying, visualization, and downstream modeling.

🧱 Architecture Overview

This project uses a modular, script-driven pipeline supported by Jupyter notebooks for exploratory work:

Raw TSVs → PostgreSQL → Soundtrack Filtering → TMDb Enrichment → Fuzzy Matching → Final Schema

Python scripts (02–10) handle data loading, enrichment, and matching

PostgreSQL serves as the central data store

Final schema includes genre-normalized join tables for easy querying

💡 Note on MusicBrainz ingestion:

While the initial ingest of MusicBrainz .tsv files is currently manual, I treated it as a simulated batch data lake. The engineering focus was on normalizing the data, resolving entity joins, and enriching it with TMDb metadata through an automated, script-driven API pipeline.

Future automation could include:

Programmatic TSV pull from MusicBrainz FTP

Script-based loader for Postgres using schema introspection

These were deferred to prioritize data integrity, enrichment accuracy, and reproducible joins — the areas providing the most analytical value.

✅ Step 4: Data Exploration & Enrichment

This step focused on verifying data quality, enriching movies via TMDb, and establishing fuzzy match pipelines to link soundtracks to their corresponding films.

Key Deliverables:

📓 Capstone_Step_4_Analysis.ipynb – Column homogeneity checks across 10 tables

📘 Step_4_wrapup.ipynb – Final Q&A, ERD, and storage discussion

🧹 Step_4_ERD.png – Visual schema overview (PostgreSQL)

🎮 Step_4_Slide_Deck.pptx – Slide walkthrough of enrichment process

Outcome:

Clean, validated soundtrack and movie data in PostgreSQL

Genre-normalized structure enables deep exploration

Ready for modeling, visualization, or feature engineering in Step 5

📈 Next Steps

Finalize genre diversity scoring strategy

Visualize genre diversity trends by decade

Model correlation between genre diversity and movie popularity

Deploy or publish key insights as part of final deliverable
